# A-Level-CS-NEA-Pulse
This is my A-Level Computer Science NEA Project Named 'Pulse' and Aims to be a DAW with Integrated Mixing

This will aim to be a simple DAW based on Audacity, however, the main focus is on the automated mixing/ DJ tool 
which will try to use basic music theory in tandem with mixing tools to automatically mix songs/ mix suggested songs 
for the user
