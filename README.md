# A-Level-CS-NEA-Pulse
This is my A-Level Computer Science NEA Project Named 'Pulse' and Aims to be an Auto Mixing Application

This will aim to be an automatic mixing tool that is able to identify songs and their key musical features (BPM, Key, Genre, Time Signature). Through this, the Application will aim to either suggest songs or allow you to provide your own songs.
